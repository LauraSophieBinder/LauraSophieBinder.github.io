			The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is an action role-playing video game developed by 
			Bethesda Game Studios and published by Bethesda Softworks. It is the fifth main 
			installment in The Elder Scrolls series, following <i>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion</i>, 
			and was released worldwide for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360 on November 11, 2011. 
			The game's main story revolves around the player's character, the Dragonborn, on their quest to defeat 
			Alduin the World-Eater, a dragon who is prophesied to destroy the world. The game is set 200 years after 
			the events of Oblivion and takes place in Skyrim, the northernmost province of Tamriel. Over the course of 
			the game, the player completes quests and develops the character by improving skills. The game continues the 
			open-world tradition of its predecessors by allowing the player to travel anywhere in the game world at any time, 
			and to ignore or postpone the main storyline indefinitely.

			They were repackaged into <b>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim – Legendary Edition</b> 
			and released in June 2013. <b>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim – Special Edition</b> 
			is a remastered version of the game released for Windows, Xbox One, and PlayStation 4 in October 2016. 
			It includes all three DLC expansions and a graphical upgrade, along with additional features such as modding 
			capabilities on consoles. Versions were released in November 2017 for the Nintendo Switch and PlayStation VR, 
			and a stand-alone virtual reality (VR) version for Windows was released in April 2018. These versions were based 
			on the remastered release, but the Switch version's graphics upgrade was relative to its hardware capabilities, and 
			it did not include the modding features.<br><br>
