    <p>Welcome to the Homepage "The Elder Scrolls", offering a source for all          knowledge on The Elder Scrolls series.
       The Elder Scrolls is a series of primarily open-world role-playing     	     video games developed by Bethesda Softworks and set on the continent of        Tamriel, a magic-infused universe with a complex history, politics, and        environment. The game's first title, The Elder Scrolls: Arena, was              released in 1994. Four additional main series games have since been            released: Daggerfall (1996), Morrowind (2002), Oblivion (2006), and            Skyrim (2011), as well as numerous spin-off titles such as Online              (2014), Legends (2017), and Blades (2019).
